A Blind dusty survey of the sky
October 10, 2014 admin	

An example of the dramatic change afforded by Herschel is shown in Figure 1. This image shows a three-colour composite with Herschel SPIRE of a small patch of sky (covering 14 by 14 square degrees). This image is only a tiny fraction of the Herschel- ATLAS project (led by Loretta Dunne and Steve Eales).

A small fraction of the Herschel ATLAS survey (Eales et al. 2010) as imaged by SPIRE (combined three colour image with blue: 250, green: 350 and red: 500Î¼m) with the Moon shown to scale. In this region alone there are literally thousands of submillimetre galaxies. The data is publicly available at http://www.h-atlas.org.
