The goal of my work is to understand the formation and evolution of cosmic dust, particularly where it is formed.  Specifically, I work on [space dust](/space-dust/) in [supernovae](/supernova-dust-factories/), in [M31](/dust-in-the-andromeda-galaxy/), in [nearby galaxies](/hrs-results/) and over recent cosmic time. This has involved using the European Space Agency’s [Herschel Space Observatory](/blind-dusty-survey-of-the-sky/) with funding from STFC and the European Research Council. See me talk about my work in this video made by the fantastic [Spectrecom Films](http://www.spectrecom.co.uk/).
