The goal of my work is to understand the formation and evolution of cosmic dust, particularly where it is formed.  Specifically, I work on [space dust](http://haley.gomez.me.uk/cosmic-dust/) in [supernovae](http://haley.gomez.me.uk/supernova-dust-factories/), in [M31](http://haley.gomez.me.uk/dust-in-the-andromeda-galaxy/), in [nearby galaxies](http://haley.gomez.me.uk/the-herschel-reference-survey-results/) and over recent cosmic time. This has involved using the European Space Agency’s [Herschel Space Observatory](http://haley.gomez.me.uk/a-blind-dust-survey-of-the-sky/) with funding from STFC.

### Lighting up the dark – the evolution of dust throughout cosmic time

In 2015, I was one of 372 scientists awarded an European Research Council Consolidator grant (€1.8million) to carry out research for 5 years. In particular, the project, called CosmicDust aims to study dust in galaxies over the past 8 billion years and to investigate dust polarization in supernovae.
