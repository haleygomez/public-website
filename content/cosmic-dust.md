In 2015, I was one of 372 scientists awarded an European Research Council Consolidator grant (â‚¬1.8million) to carry out research for 5 years. In particular, the project, called CosmicDust aims to study dust in galaxies over the past 8 billion years and to investigate dust polarization in supernovae.
